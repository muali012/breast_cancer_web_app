This project involves developing a breast cancer classification model using deep learning techniques. 

1. Image data of benign and malignant breast tumors is loaded and preprocessed.
2. A convolutional neural network based on DenseNet201 is built using Keras.
3. The model is trained on the augmented data, and its performance is evaluated.
4. The trained model is then saved for future use.
5. This project aims to accurately classify breast tumor images, contributing to cancer diagnosis and medical image analysis.

6. The project can be deployed using an AWS EC2 instance; however, the choice of instance type is limited by the fact that DenseNet201 requires higher computational resources.
